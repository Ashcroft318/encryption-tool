Set Theory : Set, Element, Subset, Proper Subset, Union, Intersection, One-to- Many, Onto

-> set is basically a collection of unique items/objects: set A = { 1,2,3,4}

-> these unique items/objects, they're usually denoted as by this: ∈ 

ex: set A = {1,2,3,4}

1 ∈ A, but {1} ∉  A*

{1}  ∉  A 

-> ⊆ - denotation of what is known as a subset - can be described as a set that contains all elements of another set.

ex: set A = { 1,2,3}  set B = {1,2,3,4,5}

A ⊆ B, B ⊄ A

-> ⊂ - denotation of what is known as a proper subset- a set that contains some, but not all, of the members of another set.

ex: set A = {1,3,5} and set B = {1,5}

A ⊂ B

-> U - denotation of what is known as a Union - sets can be combined and related to each other.

ex: set A = { 1,2,3}  and set B = { 4,5}

A U B = { 1,2,3,4,5}

-> ∩ - denotation of what is known as Intersection - defined as a set composed of al elements that belong to both A and B.

A = { 1,2,3,7,8}
B = {5,6,7,8}

A ∩ B = {7,8}


-> Injective (One-to-Many)- if for all x and y in the domain, whenever f(x) = f(y), then x = y. 

x (domain)                   f(x) = x + 2 (codomain)

1                       3
2                       4
3                       5
4                       6

-> Surjective (Onto) - is a function f such that, for every element y of function's codomain,  there exists at least one element x in the function's domain such that f(x) = y

ex: x = 1 and  f(1) = 3, x = 2 and f(2) = 3


-> Bijective - if a function f: A -> B satisfies both the injective and surjective properties.
