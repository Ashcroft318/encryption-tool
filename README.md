## C.A.S.T.L.E. (Crytographic Algorithm for Secure Transmission and Lasting Encryption)
A powerful encryption/decryption tool designed for secure communication and data protection. It enables users to encrypt and decrypt messages and files with ease, ensuring confidentiality and privacy.

## Features

- **Generate Encryption Key**: Create a new, secure encryption key for use with the tool.
- **Encrypt Messages**: Encrypt sensitive messages and store them securely.
- **Decrypt Messages**: Decrypt previously encrypted messages.
- **Encrypt Files**: Encrypt files for secure storage or transmission.
- **Decrypt Files**: Decrypt files previously encrypted using C.A.S.T.L.E.
- **View Decrypted Files**: Easily view the contents of decrypted files for verification.

## How to use:
- Essentially in order to make use of the prototype:
- when running the program at the end of the command add:  --encrypt " [insert message here]" and you'll have an encrypted message placed in a file.
- This will be the same with --decrypt.
- The difference between the encrypt/decrypt commands for messages and encrypt/decrypt files is that you have to have an output to create the files.
- With --encrypt-file:  --encrypt-file [file name here] --output [different file name here]
- With --decrypt-file:  --decrypt-file folder_name\[file name here] --output [different file name here]
